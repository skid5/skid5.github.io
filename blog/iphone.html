            <h2>iPhone 13 to iPhone 17</h2>
            <h4>11/22/2025</h4>
            <p>After 3 generations of iPhones have passed, the iPhone 17 seemed to be the first phone that was worth the upgrade. It was about time that Apple made something worth upgrading to.</p>

            <p>I've been using the new iPhone 17 base model for about 2 weeks now, and I can say the 120Hz is probably the best part about it. Coming from a base model iPhone 13, the experience is already great. The iPhone 17 could've been a "filler" phone that they put out every year if it wasn't for the decision to put a Pro display on a base model.</p>

            <p>The iPhone 17 is the first model in a while that, in my opinion, provides a significant upgrade (the last one being the iPhone X). The cherry on top is the 120Hz screen. I remember my first upgrade from a 75Hz monitor to a 165Hz one. I feel the same excitement with my phone. I was never a photography person, so I didn't see the worth of upgrading to a Pro or Pro Max model just for the screen.</p>

            <p>The camera control is also another unexpected feature for me. I had always thought it was kind of lame for Apple to add an ugly dent that you can feel (with a case) on the side of your phone. After playing around with it, I found that it would be of the most use to me if I used it for zooming. Also, center stage has been an interesting experience for me. I feel like I still need to get used to how it works. It could just be me, but it is a lot harder than it looks on the reveal.</p>

            <p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the upgrade. It's been a while since I've been able to enjoy a long-lasting battery, and I hope to keep the battery that way with an 80% charge limit. It seems that everyone else is also making the upgrade, seeing that I had a hard time finding them in stock at any Apple stores near me.</p>
