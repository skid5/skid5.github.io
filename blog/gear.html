            <h2>Current Gear</h2>
            <h4>11/10/2025</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Monitor:</b> Dell G2427D</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Solid 165hz 1440p gaming monitor. In truth, there are probably better deals out there right now with better specs but this (now discontinued) model is good enough for my everyday use.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Keyboard:</b> Arbiter Studio Phantom Polar 65</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Solid starting point if you want to get into hall effect keyboards. The sound of the keyboard isn't the best but it gets the job done. The firmware is straight forward and has the standard hall effect features but lacks compared to other brands in terms of customization. </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Mouse:</b> Lamzu Atlantis Mini 4k</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Fits all types of grips. I usually find myself using claw for gaming and palm for productivity. Battery life on 1k hz lasts about 3-5 days. Wouldn't recommend using on other polling rates as the battery life is poor in higher rates.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Mousepad: </b>Lethal Gaming Gear Saturn Pro</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">No complaints about this. The mousepad is soft and has nice stitched edges. Haven't had any issues with the texture or the speed of the mousepad. As always, cloth mousepads comes with the need for regular cleanings.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Audio: </b>Padsmith IEMS</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Very nice purple iems with a cool design. The cable is cool and the sound quality is good. Took a while for me to get used to the shape of the iems coming from the Moondrop Chu II.</li>
