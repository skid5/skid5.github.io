            <h2>Current Gear</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Monitor:</b> Dell G2427D</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Horribly priced 1440p 165hz monitor. Relatively thin bezels and have been maining it for about 1 year now. The stand is insanely bulky so use a monitor arm if you want to save space. Wouldn't recommend buying this monitor currently because there are better brands with better specs out there for cheaper. TLDR: don't buy a Dell monitor for gaming unless you want to get ripped off.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Keyboard:</b> Arbiter Studio Phantom Polar 65</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Crazy performance for the price when i bought it. Probably better keyboards now for that price or cheaper but I still think it is a good purchase. Only complaints is the spacebar rattle and the issue with supertap (snaptap) spamming a bunch of "a" and "d" keys when you press them at the same time or in short intervals. This issue only happens when typing so either I have to switch profiles which you can't do on keyboard or I have to turn off the feature while I'm in game to type. Has web drivers with straight foward settings.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Mouse:</b> Lamzu Atlantis Mini 4k</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Solid mouse for $100. Would recommend upgrading to the Maya for an extra $20. Suitable for claw and palm grips. Using this mouse with bigs hands. Only complaint is the battery life being bad on any polling rate over 1k but that is basically every wireless high polling rate mice nowadays. Includes web drivers now which is a big plus but it took a while for them to implement it for older models.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Mousepad: </b>Lethal Gaming Gear Saturn Pro</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Not a mousepad expert so I won't go into depth about the performance and all that. Very high quality and smooth mousepad. Works well for me on shooter games. The pad is soft like it is listed on the website. Comes with stitched edges.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Audio: </b>Padsmith IEMS</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet">Most likely going to be my endgame IEMS. A bit pricy at $115 but the build quality is good for the price. Shipping was also quick. I experienced pretty severe ear pains in the beginning (likely because of the shape) with the Padsmiths but after a couple of weeks my ears adjusted to the shape and now they fit comfortably for hours at a time with no pain. This might've just been an issue with my ear shape because no one else reported this. A lot more comfortable compared my previous IEMS which were the Moondrop Chu 2s. Not sure if it's earwax or the eartips but they make my ears itchy after a couple of hours.</li>
