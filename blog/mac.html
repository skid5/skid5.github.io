            <h2>1 month on Mac</h2>
            <h4>10/28/25</h4>
            <p>1 month ago, I got my hands on a 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019, and I wanted to see what it was like to use a MacBook. Previously, I had used Mac computers in class but never a MacBook. At that time, I was using a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Generation, which held up decently well. I only ever used it for school, so there were no noticeable performance issues despite its age. The only issue I ever had with it was the battery, which would only last me 3-4 hours. Although I had a charger on me at all times, it was inconvenient to have to find a plug.</p>

            <p>The condition of this laptop was incredible. It was near mint with only very tiny scratches you could barely see, and an almost new battery with only 3 cycles. For a 2019 laptop, the design was ahead with the touchbar and the screen. The screen was an upgrade compared to my X1, but it was more prone to fingerprints, and you could see them clearly, unlike my X1. In terms of the experience, it wasn't too difficult as I had used Macs before. It was nice to use something other than Windows for once.</p>

            <p>So far, I am enjoying the Mac experience, but I still want to use both laptops as there are some things on a Windows laptop that a Mac laptop can't do, and vice versa. The screen is a big pet peeve for me, and how easy it is to smudge, and also how reflective it is. There are also some software compatibility issues, like Parsec being 20 times worse on a Mac compared to Windows. Other than those issues, the Mac experience honestly isn't bad. I would rank this experience over the Windows experience because of the simplicity and how it can be used right out of the box without any extensive tweaking.</p>

            <p>I really enjoy the sleep and the nice finish on the MacBook. Even for a 2019 model, which is 6 years old at this point, it still looks really modern and nice. With ThinkPads, I think older models tend to look better than the newer ones, like the X220 series. The designs were incredible when IBM still owned the company. Nowadays, it is all about who can make the slimmest laptop, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just doesn't hit the same way compared to older stuff.</p>
